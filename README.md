Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) >=9.10.0, the [Gatsby CLI](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/) and [node-gyp](https://github.com/nodejs/node-gyp#installation) installed. The official Gatsby website also lists two articles regarding this topic:

- [Gatsby on Windows](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/gatsby-on-windows/)
- [Check your development environment](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/part-zero/)

To copy and install this starter run this command (with "project-name" being the name of your folder you wish to install it in):

```sh
gatsby new project-name https://github.com/ahmadawais/gatsby-minimal-blog
npm run dev
```

### Building your site

```sh
npm run build
```

Your site is inside the `public` folder. Deploy that to your webhost. Or it's preconfigered for Netlify can automate that for you.

**Attention:** You also need to edit ``static/robots.txt`` to include your domain!
